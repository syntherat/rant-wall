# Out Loud, but quiet

**Out Loud, but quiet** is an anonymous rant wall — a space where thoughts can be expressed freely, without noise, identity, or judgement.

It’s built for people who want to let things out without turning it into a performance.  
No followers. No clout. Just expression.

## 🌙 What is this?

Out Loud, but quiet is a minimal, anonymous ranting platform where users can:

- Post rants anonymously or under generated aliases
- React without engaging in toxic discussions
- Read others’ thoughts without judgement
- Earn in-app energy by expressing themselves
- Use that energy for subtle customisations (themes, moods, etc.)

This project focuses on **emotional expression**, **privacy**, and **clean design**, rather than engagement metrics.
